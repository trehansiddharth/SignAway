# SignAway

SignAway is a completely handheld probe that you can swipe over two signatures to algorithmically verify that they came from the same person. It is my final project for MIT's 6.115 course (Microcontrollers Lab).

## Directory Structure

- *`./Background`*: Background information on the algorithms used, such as SLAM and neural networks for signature verification.
- *`./Datasheets`*: Datasheets for the electronic components.
- *`./Designs`*: Schematics, board layouts, and CAD sketches for hardware.
- *`./Logs`*: Pictures, log files, and notes taken during development of SignAway to keep track of things.
- *`./Source`*: Source code running on the 2051 and PSoC.

## Disclaimer

Right now this is a work in progress. The deadline for completion is the end of May.
